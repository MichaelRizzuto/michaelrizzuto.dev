			<h1>Summary</h1>
			<div class="about-summary">
				<p>My name is Michael Rizzuto, I am a sixteen year old technology enthusiast based in Pennsylvania. I got my start in the gaming industry, where I still find myself spending some of my sparetime, but quickly evolved into a passion and desire to create my own games or contribute to others. During this time I also got introduced to the hosting industry where I found employment and a source of income. I spend my time nowadays enjoying my hobbies and doing freelance for others. My hobbies include gaming, as mentioned earlier, football, wrestling and overall I'm just a social person and enjoy talking with others.</p>

					<h1>2012</h1>
					<div class="timeline-cricle"></div>
					<p><b>Inception</b><br />I consider 2012 as the inception of when I started personal computing. This is when I received my first laptop and engaged in gaming. I started off in Minecraft and started showing interest in gaming communities in general.</p>

					<h1>2013</h1>
					<div class="timeline-cricle"></div>
					<p><b>Baby Steps</b><br />Here I transitioned from Minecraft to Garry's Mod and in a bigger sense into a "business" side of it. This is where I created something with my friends that opened up the world of oppurtunity in learning programming among varius other skills that would help me evolve into what I am today. Trully where I consider my start in this evolution.</p>

					<p><b>Web Development</b><br />An important part of any community is it's online presence, not just game presence. I began exploring the world of web development and went in depth in fine tuning my design skills and becoming proficient in front end, then moving to back end where I still keep up with today's practices and use my skill for hobbies.</p>

					<p><b>Community Shutdown</b><br />All good things come to an end. After and amazing six year run, it was finally time for the community to come to a close and move to bigger aspirations. With great skill in the sector I opened myself up for freelance more then previously and began doing large projects for other large end communities.<br /><br /><b>Prime Studios</b><br />Prime Studios was birthed this year and my career as a freelance web developer started. It started with a small in-house team consisting of two people.</p>
